# dotfiles
my linux dotfiles with my cool shit

So basically everything here is my configs I use. Most of these are symlinked into other locations so that I can use them easily.
All of the window managers are meant to be the same look/feel as are the terminals.
I am gonna make a guidelines file if you want to use this look and feel but with something I have not configured here.
